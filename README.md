## Project 1 - Analyzing Video with OpenCV and Numpy
### Task 1: Define a Generator for Reading a Video
```python
def get_frames(filename):
    video = cv2.VideoCapture(filename)
    while video.isOpened():
        retrieved, frame = video.read() # Obtain video frame and whether or not successfully retrieved
        if retrieved:
            yield frame # Return frame (come back to function later)
        else:
            break
    video.release() # Release resources used for video
    yield None # Return None
```
This process was simple enough. The function first opens a given video file using the cv2 library. While this video is opened, frames are read and retrieved during every iteration until the end of the video is reached. When a file is retrieved, denoted by the boolean value "retrieved", the frame is taken elsewhere, and the state of the function is saved. I don't use the "yield" keyword often in Python, but my guess is that yield is used in this instance to return to the function and continue grabbing frames of the video from where it left off.
